### Using `create-react-app` to set-up our project

We will create the Netflix-GPT project with `create-react-app`, which is a scaffolding command that will set-up a skeleton default project with `webpack` as the bundler.
It will also set up `RTL-(React Testing Library)`

We will also use tailwind throughout our project, since we will not be using classic CSS
